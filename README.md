<h1>Community Volunteer Project</h1>
<p>This is the repository for our web app. All of the files and libraries we use are contained within.</p>

<h2>The styles directory</h2>
<p>The styles directory contains all of the css for the html files, and without these files the project is not much to look at</p>

<h2>The HTML directory</h2>
<p>Source code for all the web pages is located here, along with most (if not all) the javascript that is used in the project</p>

<h2>The Scripts directory</h2>
<p>Source code for all server side interactions. There is more documentation in each of the files inside the directory</p>
